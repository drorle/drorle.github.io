<h1>Why Use The Cloud?</h1>

<h2>Cost Reduction</h2>

<h3>No need for capital expense, pay for what you use</h3>

<p>e.g.:
In the past when IT had to buy a server for some purpose, they bought the best and strongest option, just so that they can be on the safe side.
Instead in the Cloud they can allocate resources for a smaller machine and if the needs grow, they can enlarge the machine accordingly.</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<h3>Vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned quickly</h3>

<p>i.e.:
In the past you had to allocate budget for the new machine (CAPEX), get it approved, make the order, wait for the hardware to arrive, connect and install it. That could take months.
Instead in the Cloud in most cases you just need to ask for some resource and it will be provided to you within seconds.</p>

<h2>Scale and availability</h2>

<h3>The right amount of resources at the right geographic location</h3>

<p>e.g.:
If you need to add more resources in the US region and wish to reduce resources in the Far East, even if temporarily, you can easily do that.</p>

<h2>Reliability</h2>

<h3>Data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity become easier and less expensive</h3>

<p>Combined with all of the above advantages (cost reduction, speed, scale and availability) you can enable business continuity quickly, easily and pay less for it.</p>
